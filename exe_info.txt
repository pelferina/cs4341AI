																			HOW TO COMMUNICATE WITH REFEREE
																			
In order to run the .exe file with the referee just include the filename: "ConnectN.exe" from the Release folder 
in the zip file, as an argument to the Referee to be run during the tournament.

For instance, if the ConnectN.exe file and the testPlayer opponent file are located at C:\courses2015spring\ use the following command to invoke the referee:

					java -jar RefereeForDebug.jar "java -jar C:\courses2015spring\testPlayer1.jar" "C:\courses2015spring\ConnectN.exe" 6 7 3 10 10
					
				
NOTE: The program can only run with another player as the functionality to be played against itself has not been implemented
