							EXPERIMENT REPORT

Our original plan for heuristics was to simply count the number of combos (lines of 2, 3, 4, etc) of each length, and to compare 
the opponents number and the player’s number. The AI would make moves that increased their own combos, and decreased the number of 
the opponent’s combos.

In testing we realized that we needed to weight the larger combos, or else the AI would think that four lines of 2 is the same value
 as a single line of 8, which is much more difficult to accomplish. To fix this failure, we redesigned our heuristics, by weighting 
each combo length as it’s length squared. This made the AI want to destroy its opponents long combos as much as possible, resulting 
in a much better AI.

We also decided that we would use more time and processing power to really make our combo counter think well. Instead of simply counting
 combos that exist on the board, we made our heuristic only count combos that can actually be completed to win the game. That way,
 the AI would not try to make a combo better when it is a dead end and nothing good will come of it. We decided that this was a good 
trade off of having to calculate more spaces.
